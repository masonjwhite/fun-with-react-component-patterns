# Fun With React Component Patterns

This repository is a part of my "fun with" series. Each and every day I challenge myself to learn something new. Once I feel like I understand a subject well enough to move onto the next one, I build a small proof of concept or example so that I can reference it in the future. It also has the double benefit of serving as a great learning resource for my Bootcamp students.

In anticipation of my upcoming React Bootcamp lessons (and of course for my own reference) I created this repo of react component patterns!

## Included Examples

- Higher Order Component
- Render Prop (using children called as a function)
- Render Prop Alternate (using traditional "render" prop)
- Container Component
- Context/Provider Pattern

## TODO

- [] React Hooks
