# Fun With React Component Patterns

This repository is a part of my "fun with" series. Each and every day I challenge myself to learn something new. Once I feel like I understand a subject well enough to move onto the next one, I build a small proof of concept or example so that I can reference it in the future. It also has the double benefit of serving as a great learning resource for my Bootcamp students.

In anticipation of my upcoming React Bootcamp lessons (and of course for my own reference) I created this repo of react component patterns!

## Structure

This project was bootstrapped with create-react-app. It contains several examples of well-known React component patterns. Currently all of the component examples are being used in the top-level App component, however, I will be refactoring the examples using react-router in the future. 

## Starting the project

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the cloned project and run `yarn install`
3. To start the project, run `yarn start`

## Included Examples

- 01-Higher Order Component
- 02-Render Prop (using children called as a function)
- 03-Render Prop Alternate (using traditional "render" prop)
- 04-Container Component
- 05-Context/Provider Pattern
- 06-React Hooks

## TODO

- [] Implement React Router so examples render on different pages
- [] React Hooks
